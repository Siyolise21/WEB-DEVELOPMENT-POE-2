#### STUDENT INFORMATION:

#### PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Is a NPO pursuing the mission to improve children’s literacy 
and combating youth unemployment led by Zama Zulu. Using 
data-driven, scalable programmes and creating meaningful 
local jobs for previously unemployed youth especially women 
as literacy coaches in early learning and primary school 
settings. The organisation was founded in 2008 by Jim 
McKeown and Fiks Mahola, they met in New Brighton in 
Gqeberha and bonded over shared passion for uplifting 
communities.   


#### WEBSITE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES:
I would like for the website to attract potential investors to this organisation, more people to 
see the cause and be an easy way to provide information to users/people of interest. More 
users interacting with the website means more people are aware of the cause, maybe some 
might be interested to assist to better the community and the children.  

#### KEY FUNCTIONS AND FUNCTIONALITY:
I would improve the websites navigation such as add search functions and site maps, make 
the website easier to use none of that complicated/amateur functions. I would like to show 
more visuals instead of text to catch the users attention. I would like to also use more fonts, 
colour palettes and layout choices.
